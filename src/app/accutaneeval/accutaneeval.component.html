                <p>All patients approved for Accutane will be enrolled in the iPledge program and will be prompted to
                    get bloodwork done after 2 months into treatment.</p><br>

                <p>Female patients are required to either pledge abstinence or be on two forms of approved birth control
                    during treatment. Female patients must also take monthly pregnancy tests every month (which can be
                    done at home) and upload the results to the portal after their doctor approves the monthly
                    prescription as well as answer monthly questions on the ipledgeprogram.com website.</p>

                <p>Per iPledge requirements for female patients, if approved for Accutane by your assigned dermatologist
                    after submitting this evaluation, there will be a 30 day mandatory "wait period" before receiving
                    your first supply of pills.</p>
